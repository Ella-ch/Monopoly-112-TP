Title - Monopoly
The game is played by at least two and up to four players.
In this game, players could either win by buying and developing their own properties and forcing your rivals into bankruptcy, or they could lose by experiencing their own bankruptcy. Being the last player remaining with money is their goal.
In addition, when the players reach the chance card grids, they will randomly draw a chance card, which might give them a magic card, cost their money, be send to jail, or etc.
Players could choose to upgrade their properties or sell them when stepping on their land.

During their turn, users will be prompted to decide whether to purchase the unowned property they have landed on or pass on the opportunity. If a user purchases a property, the color of the property will change to match the user's designated color.

When a user lands on a property owned by another player, they will be charged a penalty fee, the value of which is determined by the level and value of the property.
