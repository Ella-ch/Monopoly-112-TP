Title - Monopoly
The game is played by at least two and up to four players.
In this game, players could either win by buying and developing their own properties and forcing your rivals into bankruptcy, or they could lose by experiencing their own bankruptcy. Being the last player remaining with money is their goal.
In addition, when the players reach the chance card grids, they will randomly draw a chance card, which might give them a magic card, cost their money, be send to jail, or etc.
Players could choose to upgrade their properties or sell them when stepping on their land.
